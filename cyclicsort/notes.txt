When given numbers range from 1 to n, use cyclec sort.
What is cyclic sort?
  --- N numbers are given , after sorting these numbers, index = value -1 (because array index start from 0, and ele are from 1 to n).
  --- so , first check if value is at the correct index , if not swap with correct index else continue.
In this way, every unique element is goint to swap only once, so number of comparisions required in the worst case are (n-1 + n) = 2n -1 = 0(n) ... constants ignored
